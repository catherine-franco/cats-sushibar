## Overview

This project is a 3D web application designed to deliver an immersive/interactive experience, showcasing the integration of 3D graphics within web browsers. Cat's Sushi Bar harnesses three.js, a comprehensive JavaScript library designed for rendering 3D graphics within web browsers, and Blender 2.0, an industry-standard open-source 3D modeling and animation suite, used to create custom 3D assets for this project. CSB was initially conceptualized in 2022 as a personal 3D portfolio, the scope has evolved to prioritize rapid deployment and extensibility.

## Features
- Real-time interactive 3D rendering.
- Custom-built, high-fidelity models and textures developed entirely in Blender.
- Under Construction: Optimization for cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
- Under Construction: Modular architecture for future extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of additional projects and features.

### Built With
- [Blender 2.8](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-80/) - Open-source 3D modeling and animation suite.
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/) - comprehensive JavaScript library designed for rendering 3D graphics within web browsers.

## Development Timeline
- Initial Concept: Initial concept development as a 3D portfolio.
- Current Phase: Expediting deployment and focusing on modular architecture.
